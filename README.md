The Heuristic Evolutionary Rule Optimization System (HEROS) is a supervised rule-based machine learning algorithm designed to train on structured data and yield compact human interpretable solutions.   This implementation is scikit-learn compatible.

The first paper on HEROS was recently accepted at GECCO 2025.  This repostitory will be made public prior to its publication.
